Today we feature HERMES DeFi, its pre-sale will start in approximately 28 hours. @valleyrider from the team will tell us who they are, why HERMES DeFi is better, the tokenomics, their roadmap, and how to participate their pre-sale. Chat has been muted, it's all yours now @valleyrider</td>
            <td>Hello to all of you guys. Thank you very much for inviting me to come today. 

            	<br>
            	<br>

I'll try to explain all this as directly as possible, I hope I don't take too long!

<br>
<br>

With respect to the background of the equipment our team consists of 4 people. 3 of them related for a long time with the world of cryptocurrencies, the fourth one is facing his first project as assistant to the main back end developer. As you can see we have two people in the contracts section and another one in the front end development. I am in charge of the administration of everything, due to my studies at the business university I feel comfortable in this position and I try to take advantage of the existing opportunities.

<br>
<br>

This is the part in which I will go on for a long time because it is the most open part, the goal of the project is to establish itself as an important player in the Defi world starting as a farm but without limiting itself in the future only to this. There are numerous options on the table, some farms try to take the step to become AMM through the accumulation of funds in vaults, others propose a credit and loan system or even the creation of another farming token and use the current governance token. We must be honest and be aware that we are currently far from that point, there is a lot of work to be done before we get there, the option of developing another layered farming is also possible to accumulate more visibility and funds in case the first farming does not reach the target. Right now the furthest point I have in my mind is to develop an attractive vaulting system, a USDC payment system for owning IRIS, the possibility that other tokens use our platform for their launch. Also to be able to take our project to other blockchains, right now KCC and Solana are the ones that hover in my head. Once we get there the next step will be raised. I am a person who sets close but achievable goals.

<br>
<br>

What makes Hermes Defi different? I can give you a couple of quick reasons. The first and most easily distinguishable is our design, this has been under development for about 3 weeks and hopes to set a trend in the Defi world, we have made its code free so that anyone can access it and use it in their project (we believe in free code). Beyond what can be seen at a simple view I would say that the ecosystem created is solid and investor friendly, thanks to a clean launch (ironically a clean and safe in the Defi world right now is through a pre-sale) and deposit fees system transparent and created in the most efficient way (you can see the logic in our litepaper).

<br>
<br>

About tokenomics we could say that our tokenomics are designed to provide a 6-week farming period where the team has the time to develop and implement the products but at the same time this period is not too long and the farm falls into disuse. We want to provide news and advances every week,to form a dynamic project and generate external attention. Also we have reduced the typical 10% of the mined amount for the owner to 5% and created a token with no transfer taxes.

<br>
<br>

Well, I have already talked about our long term future, in the short term (which will be our roadmap to follow in the coming weeks), the first thing will be to provide total security in our project through KYC and the full audit of Paladin. In the medium term the Balancer pools will be a priority, also an autocompounding of our token is also on the horizon and the possibility of staking IRIS to obtain tokens of new projects that will be born in Polygon. Creating an opinion tab within the website where the community will suggest, vote and we will propose ideas to get feedback from the community will be another priority. On the other hand, it will be necessary to expand the team so that everyone can specialize more in their area of work and achieve greater development.

<br>
<br>

And last but not least how to invest in Hermes Defi and some key points on how we will manage the launch of the token, The pre-sale will be done through the FENIX token which can be obtained through MATIC on our website. 20% of IRIS will be purchased through FENIX, half of the pre-sale funds (10%) will be pooled with 5% of the IRIS that I currently hold in my wallet creating the LP with which I will add liquidity, allowing investors to get at least a x2 on their investment if the pre-sale is completed and a x1.5 in the worst case scenario. All unsold tokens will be sent to the dead adress. We will leave 5 days from the start of the pre-sale until liquidity is added for investors who want to buy more tokens to do so and those who want to exit before the start as well (telegram channel will be used to manage sell and buy orders). Once liquidity has been added everyone will be able to do so, and 2 hours later the FENIX for IRIS exchange contract will be open where pre-sale buyers will be able to exchange their FENIXs. After two days the farming will start and IRIS rewards will start to be generated by our masterchef.

<br>

And this is all from my part, thank you very much again for letting me participate in this presentation of my project, you can access all the information and social media through our website https://www.hermesdefi.io/
