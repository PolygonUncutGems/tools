            <td  style="vertical-align: top;">Hello guys! Thanks for tunning in our 3rd AMA, this time with @PolyMaxDeFi and @polymaxultra from the PolyMax team. They are launching its new layer INFERNO later today! To get things started, could you introduce yourselves? What is PolyMax, how did it all started, and what's your role?</td>
            
            <td  style="vertical-align: top;">Thanks for having us, its a pleasure to be here.

            	<br>
            	<br>

<strong>Mostly Max:</strong>Polymax is a layer farm project that we started in June.  We have put out 5 farms, Inferno will be our 6th.  MAX is our Master token that we have kept going since the initial farm.  My role is more of operations, communications, about half the strategy, and some of the marketing.  I will let Ultra say a few words about himself.

<br>
<br>

<strong>Ultra Max:</strong> I handle the tech side of the project.

    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Thanks guys. How often do you guys put out new farms? What is the general game plan here?
    		</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Ultra had some code that was near ready to deploy and asked if I would help do this with him.  Having been getting deeper into crypto and defi, I was interested to see how the view from the Dev side looked, so I went along with it.

                <br>
                <br>

            It has been a moving target, First one was about 3 weeks before it fizzled out, then we went to one a week for a couple, right now we are at about one every 2 weeks.

            <br>
            <br>

        gameplan too is evolving. We are trying to mix what we can do safely, with what our community wants, and things we want to try out. We are trying to grow this into something bigger. we keep slowly adding new features and toying with stuff to look for better results for all parties. At the end of the day, most people are interested in farming because fo the money, so we try to drive value for MAX holders, people that support our work. </td>

    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Sounds good, it has been a great ride so far man. I have been with PolyMax since the first farm, the first one had a crazy launch if I remembered correctly?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Yeah, the token skyrocketed, maybe got up to 16k a piece?  it was mostly just because we launched it with such little liquidity. We also knew how fast it was going to fall, so we were active in warning people about buying it before launch, but was exciting for us regardless.</td>

    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">But it definitely got you guys a lot of attention I think.</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Yeah, but even in that couple of months, I think the community of farmers has gotten wiser. Something like that isn't maybe a good thing and more of a red flag now. Just shows how fast defi is moving. It was our first farm, we were just learning, and this is all still experimental.</td>

    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">True. I will probably warn people here if I see that nowadays NGL haha. Tell us a bit about your previous layer GRATITUDE, what was changed, and how did it go?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Gratitude has maybe been from a operational standpoint our best farm. We did a number of things. 

                <br>
                <br>

We didnt take any dev pay on it, all deposit fees went back into liquidity. We changed up tokenomics, it was steady low emissions. We had done a step down previously. We also instituted a tax that automatically provided liquidity.

<br>
<br>

The all fees for liquididty portion was supposed to be a thank you for the community supporting us, hence the name</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Really cool. Stronger liquidity definitely help, and give investors confident while the tokenomics give the farm a healthy growth.

                <br>
                <br>

Let's talk more about this up coming layer. When does the token drops? when farming starts? What is the tokenomics? What's new?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Token drops in about 90 minutes. We typically add $200, this time we are adding $800 along with 800 flame tokens. 

                <br>
                <br>

We have some anitbot stuff on this one that I will let Ultra describe, and while he types that out I will go over a few other points. 

<br>
<br>

The tokenomics will be about the same. We pre minted a few extra for this promotion here, but other than that should be about the same tokenomics.

<br>
<br>

<strong>Ultra Max:</strong> We are enforcing antiwhale of 2.5% of circulating supply with 1 txn per wallet per block limit making it really difficult to snipe our launch.

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">As GRATITUDE right? So decent amount pre-mint and what is the emission rate again?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Emission will be .01flame/block. So that will be about 400/day for about 2 weeks. Also, with the tax, we have an additional feature on this one that people should be aware of. Once we add the liquidity, for the first 10800 blocks, or about 6 hours, the tax will be 10%. We are hoping that this will either scare away bots, or they can really help our liquidity efforts, because if they are just speculating on the launch, for a few minutes, that is some pretty heavy transaction fees, that will automatically create lp.</td>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">That is very interesting, tax the botters, speculators heavy! I like it.</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> We want the people that are interested in the whole project to get a piece of the upside of the launch, not people with no attachment to the project. We have tried this a few different ways in the past, this is our latest version</td>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Thats great, love seeing you guys keep involving. I also noticed that there are couple Burn Valuts in INFERNO, can you explan how they work?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> So one of the criticism we have had with our farms is that we only care the max token over, not the other ones. This is an attempt to solve that.

                <br>
                <br>

You will be able to deposit gratitude on this farm, but once you do it is gone for good. You will earn flame for the rest of the farm for that deposit, but after that, the coin is retired and we burn it. We are doing it with our single max pool too. 

<br>
<br>

This has a different thought process. This is more to shrink the supply of MAX to help increase the price. On top of that, we have a max/usdc farm with 0% deposit fee to help improve liquidity with it. Right now we plan to do a burn pool for the previous farm's native token to retire it on our farms going forward.</td>

    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">I think you guys have done great so far and kept all the promises. Any future plan you can share with us? What can we expect from you? Any partnerships in the working?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> With all the scammers out there, we have done 5 farms now and I cant think of anything we said we would do that we havent, that should count for something

                <br>
                <br>

            PUG has been our first step into that direction. We are very open to the idea, but have a very limited budget. Not to complain or anything, but a lot of stuff like that can get pretty pricey and we just haven't made that much money on these so far. 

            <br>
            <br>

        One thing I really want to do is presale. I think we are getting close with the code, and I think it can answer a lot of questions for us. A lot of the bigger farms do presale and I hope it can push us higher. Other than that, I think we just do the incremental improvements we have been working towards. I like the tax and deflationary aspect of our current stuff and we have been exploring some ideas around that, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Having trouble accessing the roadmap. Can you tell me what you're most excited about coming up?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> Right now im curious to see about how much the burn farms get engaged, and how the 10% tax works with people. 

                <br>
                <br>

Down the road, I want it to be more about growth. We feel like we know how to run a farm now, we want to do bigger farms that last longer, have more stable price on native, etc. Like I was saying earlier though, I think a big part of that is presale, im hoping that soon we can get enough support to fill on that</td>

    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">What’s your best plan to mitigate the inevitable farm dump?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> This burn gratitude pool is a move in that direction, its a bit of a poor mans version of the PWAC trade in. 

                <br>
                <br>

            That way we can layer farm and people know there is inherent value at the next farm level, so the dump shouldnt be as bad.</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Do you have any planned utility?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> We try to give MAX the utility, for our past few farms, it has been 0% deposit so rewards are free for holding it and no more will be minted. Acts similar to a dividend.</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">What was your reasoning behind the chosen initial minted token as well as initial price?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mostly Max:</strong> More initial liquidity or just liquidity in general slows the process too,  but at the end of the day we are a degen farm project right now. Ultra probably has the skillset to put together a AMM or something, but we just havent gone there yet.

                <br>
                <br>

            The size of initial mint is more of a ratio decision, the initial mint compared to the emission rate. You can play around with the numbers as long as the other follows proportionally. Not sure we have hit the sweet spot yet, but we definitely got closer on the last one. As for price, that is more of what we can afford to provide out of pocket. For instance, with the $800 we will provide on the launch today, that means we have to hit $25k TVL of pools that pay deposit fees just to break even on this. I wish we could do $8,000 and have them be $10/flame, but that jut isnt realistically in our budget. </td>
