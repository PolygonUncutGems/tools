            <td  style="vertical-align: top;">Okay guys, Let's start the presentation/AMA. Welcome to the Uncut Gems Community room @Cryptosharkbait , and congrats on the L2 launch today! Please give us some background on SunsetCryoto Finance, what we need to know?</td>
            
            <td  style="vertical-align: top;">Hey all pleasure to be here, and as many of you know I am CryptoSharkbait owner of Sunset Finance and I am here to give you guys the inside scoop of our project! We already launched Layer 1 which was a great learning experience we partnered up with Token Factory they were the ones who coded our farm and we were very limited in what we could do it was very much proof of concept, more than anything. We did well in a couple of aspects thanks to many moving parts. One, being as transparent as possible which I think won over alot of peoples decision in coming to invest in our farm. Two, the amazing partnership of Polytopia and their wonderful team has been super helpful and supportive during every stage of this project so far. Lastly the amazing connections that I have created since launch of Layer 1 Defi Dave being the most notable and I am so grateful the way that everything happened.

            	<br>
            	<br>

The most blaring problem we had with Layer 1 was lack of liquidity. This was addressed in the launch of Layer 2 by adding a Transfer Tax of 5% on buying, selling ,and transferring wallets that auto adds and burns liquidity raising the price floor. The other problem that we had on Layer 1 that many were upset by was our UI Glitch on one of the LP pairs which we had no control over and warned people about but there was alot going on so I understand and empathize with people that were misinformed. 

<br>
<br>

We Have Created many new partnerships Astrofarms, XUSD, And Polygon Punks to name a few some I can't go public with till they are final but all key moving parts to promoting longevity in our project.

<br>
<br>

Despite being a yield farm the main feature of our farm will be being a Yield Aggregator with Auto Compounding Vaults like you see with Beefy.Finance. We hope to bring incentivizing fees and future projects that can be listed there for months and years to come. We hope to compete with the big boys and I will do everything in my power to give you the best project possible.

<br>
<br>

I will be happy to answer any questions anyone has thanks for having me on KEE!!!!</td>

    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Thats awesome man! I was just reading through your message, and there are a lot of interesting points there. I will ask a few questions, and then I will hand it over to the community.

<br>
<br>

So beside you and also Dave being a community mod. Who else in your team, and whats their role and background?
    		</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">So Instead of going with Token Factory to create our Layer 2 I decided to hire Two Devs one being a smart contract coder the other doing Front End work both are respected members in this community one of them wanting to be ANON for now so out of respect I will keep it that way. Our Number 1 mod @Rsfancy who has been an amazing friend even before creating this helped me through some tough losses in defi and we have about 3 or 4 more people that help answer some questions in chat.</td>

    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Awesome, I spent some time in your Tg and I can confirm that your team is awesome, and $SUN community there is very strong.</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">I appreciate it man it means a lot we have grown organically throughout the whole process wouldn't have it any other way!</td>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">So if I understand correctly, the L2 farm, which you just stealth launched its token today, will serve as both a farm and also a yield aggregator? For the yield aggregator, will people receive $SUNSET token rewards on top of compounding LP?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">As far as that is planned no we will just be an autocompounding service with very amazing fees that are better than most! Our tokenomics for our farm are done so in the fact that it will emit rewards for about 900 days and we will continue to add features along the way to preserve the life of the coin like dividends and what not.</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Sounds good! I assume the tokenomics will be very different from the L1 token $SUN? Could you share some details here?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Correct Emission is almost 4 times slower at 0.0015 a block which equates to about 50 coins a day our max supply is 45k SUNSET coins. The main bonus of the token is the 5% transfer tax on Buying,Selling, and Transferring of wallets which will continually raise the liquidity by its auto add and burn liquidity function. Mathematically speaking the coin will never go to 0 it is impossible!</td>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">That's some great developments on L2 man! congrats! Can't wait to see more. I want to ask what is the plan for the L1 token $SUN. What are the benefits of holding it?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">So $SUN will have the second highest multiplier on the farm in terms of emissions of  yield earned at of course a 0% deposit fee so you can most definitely use $SUN in L2 and be rewarded greatly for it!</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Does $SUN have a maximum supply?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">yes 10k so the farm rewards will end in about 5 weeks on SUN L1</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">That is awesome. In terms of partnerships, What you guys have done so far? could you go into some of the details? Any what's is your game plan with Astrofarms and PolyPunks specifically?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Astrofarms has been gracious enough to let us use their Governance token in our farm LEO which has a max supply of 100 and has over a 100k Marketcap last time I checked we will be listed on their next farm $VIRGO which will be out at the end of the month! Polygon Punks I need to finalize some things but thinking of doing a giveaway of some punks! I own 5 now and I am addicted they will be very valuable over time!</td>
    	</tr>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">I'm a big fan of Astrofarms, shared them here when they first released $LEO. Glad seeing you guys are working together!</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Yes good people</td>

    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Okay, I think thats pretty much it for me. Before I reopen the chat, anything else you want to add, or what else we can expect from your L2 farm?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Nothing other than I just want to bring a safe investing environment and grow our community organically we are coming together strongly! There are alot of rugs on polygon now and  I want to prove that our project and mission is to be nothing other than transparent and hardworking. I take this very seriously I know whats at stake and nothing is going to stop me from doing those things honesty is key in this space!</td>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">You mentioned partnership with PolyPunk, how will you be integrating the use of NFT into your farm?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Potentially yes I hope we can integrate some farming aspect that people can earn yield by buying a Punk</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">There are a bunch of other major projects going on right now. How are you going to compete with the bigger farms/autocompounding services/yield aggregators?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Our plan well mine in specific is to outwork any project out there whether that be through marketing or networking I want people to chose us over the big boys because we have a better community and better rewards and fees</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">I see many farms are launching also layer 4 tokens. Do you really think that launch many layer token and farms are good to keep a healthy economy in a defi? what do you think about the future layers in yours?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">This will be the last layer the farm will run whether people like it or not for 900 days so the main feature of the farm will be an auto compounding service that will evolve with many different features and projects!</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">So you said the farm's going to be running for 900 days. Do you plan on working on only this project or are you going to be working on others as well?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Possibly going to work on a massive project on the Harmony Network with some people+ My team but more details way down the road!</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">for those that were not present at the launch today, @Cryptosharkbait would you mind explaining a bit of that and why so much of the initial supply has been burnt?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">So basically what happened is we tried to do a fair launch by posting the contract info a few moments before adding liquidity which was a mistake someone thought it would be smart to add a small amount of liquidity for the chance to dump on people he failed and got dumped on so we had to burn extra tokens</td>
    	</tr>
    </tbody>

    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">any incoming/ongoing audits or ads?</td>
    		<td  style="vertical-align: top;">Not as of now when we do our vaults then we will probably get a prestigious audit</td>
